# Phase 2 Remaining Features Validation Tests

This file contains test prompts to validate the newly implemented Phase 2 features for context management:

1. **Smart Prioritization**: Relevance-based snippet ranking
2. **Cross-Turn Correlation**: Linking related code across turns  
3. **Intelligent Summarization**: Context-aware compression
4. **Dynamic Context Expansion**: Automatic file discovery

## Test 1: Smart Prioritization Validation

**Goal**: Test relevance-based ranking of code snippets and tool results.

```
I'm working on optimizing the context management system in this DevOps agent. I need to understand how the smart prioritization feature works and see it in action. Can you:

1. Read the smart_prioritization.py file to understand the implementation
2. Look at how it's integrated in the context_manager.py 
3. Create a simple Python function that demonstrates the ranking algorithm
4. Show me how different factors (recency, content relevance, error priority) influence the scoring

I'm particularly interested in seeing how code snippets with different characteristics get ranked relative to each other.
```

**Expected Validation**: 
- Should see smart prioritization being applied during context assembly
- Should observe detailed logging of relevance scores
- Should see different code snippets ranked by relevance factors

## Test 2: Cross-Turn Correlation Testing

**Goal**: Test relationship detection between code and tool results across turns.

```
I want to test the cross-turn correlation feature. Let's work with multiple related files:

1. First, read the cross_turn_correlation.py file to understand how it works
2. Then read the context_manager.py file to see the integration
3. Create a small Python module with a main.py that imports from utils.py
4. Run some commands that interact with both files
5. Search for content in these files using codebase search
6. Edit one of the files

I want to see how the correlation system links these related activities across different conversation turns.
```

**Expected Validation**:
- Should see correlation scores being calculated between related items
- Should observe file similarity and content similarity scoring
- Should see temporal proximity and tool sequence analysis in action

## Test 3: Intelligent Summarization Demonstration

**Goal**: Test context-aware content compression for different content types.

```
I need to test the intelligent summarization feature with different types of content:

1. Read the intelligent_summarization.py file to understand the implementation
2. Create a large Python file with classes, functions, imports, and comments
3. Create a JSON configuration file with various settings
4. Create a markdown documentation file with multiple sections
5. Run a shell command that produces substantial output
6. Use the codebase search to find content across multiple files

I want to see how the intelligent summarizer handles each content type differently and preserves the most important information while reducing size.
```

**Expected Validation**:
- Should see content type detection working for different files
- Should observe structured summarization preserving key elements
- Should see compression ratios and content transformation logging

## Test 4: Dynamic Context Expansion Testing

**Goal**: Test automatic discovery of relevant files based on context and errors.

```
Let me test the dynamic context expansion feature by simulating various scenarios:

1. First, read the dynamic_context_expansion.py file to understand the implementation
2. Create a Python file that imports a module that doesn't exist (to trigger import errors)
3. Try to run this file to generate an ImportError
4. Create some related Python files in different directories (src/, lib/, etc.)
5. Work with configuration files that reference other files
6. Search for specific keywords across the project

I want to see how the system automatically discovers and suggests relevant files based on errors, dependencies, and keyword matching.
```

**Expected Validation**:
- Should see error-driven context expansion triggering
- Should observe file dependency analysis working
- Should see directory structure exploration finding relevant files
- Should see keyword-based discovery in action

## Test 5: End-to-End Integration Test

**Goal**: Test all Phase 2 features working together in a realistic scenario.

```
Now let's do a comprehensive test of all Phase 2 features working together:

1. I have a complex task: "Implement a new feature for the agent that adds logging capabilities with configurable output formats"

2. Let's start by understanding the current project structure
3. Look for existing logging implementations
4. Check configuration files for current logging settings
5. Create a draft implementation that might have some errors
6. Try to run/test the implementation
7. Fix any issues that arise
8. Document the new feature

Throughout this process, I want to see:
- Smart prioritization ranking relevant files higher
- Cross-turn correlation linking related activities
- Intelligent summarization keeping content concise but informative  
- Dynamic context expansion automatically finding relevant files when we encounter issues

This should demonstrate all the Phase 2 features working together in a realistic development workflow.
```

**Expected Validation**:
- Should see all Phase 2 features working in concert
- Should observe automatic context enrichment and optimization
- Should see intelligent handling of errors and context expansion
- Should demonstrate improved context relevance and efficiency

## Test 6: Performance and Metrics Validation

**Goal**: Validate performance improvements and logging metrics.

```
I want to analyze the performance impact and effectiveness of the new Phase 2 features:

1. Look at the comprehensive logging that's been implemented
2. Show me examples of token utilization before and after Phase 2 features
3. Demonstrate the context assembly process with detailed logging
4. Show me examples of relevance scoring and ranking decisions
5. Display correlation analysis between different context items
6. Show me summarization compression ratios and effectiveness

I want to understand how these features improve context quality while managing token usage efficiently.
```

**Expected Validation**:
- Should see detailed metrics and performance logging
- Should observe improved context relevance and utilization
- Should see evidence of intelligent optimization working
- Should demonstrate measurable improvements in context management

## Running These Tests

To run these tests with the end-to-end validation strategy:

```bash
# Test Smart Prioritization
./prompt.sh "$(cat example_prompts/test_phase2_remaining_features.md | grep -A 20 'Test 1:')"

# Test Cross-Turn Correlation  
./prompt.sh "$(cat example_prompts/test_phase2_remaining_features.md | grep -A 20 'Test 2:')"

# Test Intelligent Summarization
./prompt.sh "$(cat example_prompts/test_phase2_remaining_features.md | grep -A 20 'Test 3:')"

# Test Dynamic Context Expansion
./prompt.sh "$(cat example_prompts/test_phase2_remaining_features.md | grep -A 20 'Test 4:')"

# Test End-to-End Integration
./prompt.sh "$(cat example_prompts/test_phase2_remaining_features.md | grep -A 30 'Test 5:')"

# Test Performance Validation
./prompt.sh "$(cat example_prompts/test_phase2_remaining_features.md | grep -A 20 'Test 6:')"
```

## Expected Outcomes

After running these tests, you should observe:

1. **Smart Prioritization**: Code snippets and tool results ranked by relevance with detailed scoring
2. **Cross-Turn Correlation**: Related items linked across conversation turns with correlation analysis
3. **Intelligent Summarization**: Different content types compressed appropriately while preserving key information
4. **Dynamic Context Expansion**: Automatic discovery of relevant files based on errors and context
5. **Integrated Performance**: All features working together to provide superior context management
6. **Detailed Metrics**: Comprehensive logging showing the impact and effectiveness of each feature

This validates that all Phase 2 features are working correctly and providing the intended improvements to context management.
