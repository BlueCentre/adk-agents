# Enhanced CLI Features Test

## Description
Test the enhanced CLI features including multi-line input, mouse support, auto-completion, and history features.

## Test Cases

### 1. Multi-line Input Test
```
Create a Python function that:
- Takes a list of numbers as input
- Calculates the mean, median, and mode
- Returns a dictionary with the results
- Include proper error handling
- Add type hints and docstrings
```

**Expected Behavior**: User should be able to type this multi-line request and submit it with Alt+Enter.

### 2. Auto-completion Test
Type: `create a docker` and press Tab

**Expected Behavior**: Should show completion suggestions like:
- create a dockerfile
- create docker-compose.yml

### 3. History and Auto-suggestion Test
1. Type: `analyze this code`
2. Press Enter to submit
3. Start typing `ana` again

**Expected Behavior**: Should show auto-suggestion from history

### 4. Mouse Support Test
**Expected Behavior**: 
- Mouse clicks should position cursor
- Mouse selection should work for copy/paste
- Mouse scroll should work in completion menus

### 5. Special Commands Test
- Type `help` - should show help message
- Type `clear` - should clear screen  
- Press Ctrl+L - should clear screen
- Press Ctrl+D - should exit gracefully

### 6. DevOps-specific Completions Test
Type partial commands and press Tab:
- `setup monitor` → should suggest "setup monitoring for"
- `create helm` → should suggest "create helm chart for"
- `deploy to` → should suggest "deploy to production", "deploy to staging"

### 7. Error Handling Test
- Press Ctrl+C during input - should cancel current input
- Press Ctrl+D with empty input - should exit
- Press Ctrl+D with text - should delete before cursor
