# Prompt Engineering Excellence - Validation Test

**Date:** December 2024  
**Feature:** Restructured prompts with clear directive hierarchy and tool usage patterns  
**Goal:** Validate that AI model decision-making and context usage is improved

## üéØ Test Overview

We completely restructured the prompts to provide clearer directive hierarchy, explicit context block usage instructions, and optimized tool sequencing patterns. This should improve the AI model's ability to make good decisions and use context effectively.

## üß™ Test Sequence

### **Test 1: Directive Hierarchy Following**
**Objective:** Verify the agent follows the priority directive structure

#### Test 1.1: AGENT.md Context Usage
```bash
./prompt.sh "I want to understand how this agent is supposed to work operationally. What are the key procedures and workflows I should know about?"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should reference AGENT.md explicitly
- Should use operational context from the file
- Should demonstrate understanding of documented procedures

#### Test 1.2: System Context Block Usage  
```bash
./prompt.sh "Based on the current project structure and recent changes, what should be my next development priorities?"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should extract and reference specific details from SYSTEM CONTEXT blocks
- Should mention specific file paths, line numbers, or error messages from context
- Should build incrementally on provided context

#### Test 1.3: Tool-First Problem Solving
```bash
./prompt.sh "I'm having trouble understanding what's in this project"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should use tools to find information before asking questions
- Should demonstrate self-sufficient behavior
- Should proceed with directory listing, file reading, or searching

### **Test 2: Tool Sequencing Pattern Recognition**
**Objective:** Verify the agent follows optimized workflow patterns

#### Test 2.1: Code Analysis Workflow
```bash
./prompt.sh "I think there might be some import errors in the Python code. Can you help me find and understand them?"
```

**Expected Tool Sequence:**
```
codebase_search (import errors) ‚Üí read_file (specific files) ‚Üí code_analysis (if needed)
```

#### Test 2.2: Debugging Workflow
```bash
./prompt.sh "The agent isn't working properly and I'm seeing some error messages in the logs"
```

**Expected Tool Sequence:**
```
grep_search (error patterns) ‚Üí read_file (context around errors) ‚Üí execute_shell_command (reproduce/test)
```

#### Test 2.3: Implementation Workflow
```bash
./prompt.sh "I want to add a new feature to the context management system"
```

**Expected Tool Sequence:**
```
index_directory ‚Üí retrieve_code_context (related patterns) ‚Üí edit_file ‚Üí execute_shell_command (test/validate)
```

### **Test 3: Tool Selection Intelligence**
**Objective:** Verify appropriate tool selection based on clear guidelines

#### Test 3.1: Conceptual vs Exact Search
```bash
./prompt.sh "I want to understand how error handling works in this codebase"
```
**Expected:** Should use `codebase_search` (conceptual query)

```bash
./prompt.sh "Find all instances of the exact string 'RecursionError' in the code"
```
**Expected:** Should use `grep_search` (exact text match)

#### Test 3.2: File vs Directory Operations
```bash
./prompt.sh "I know there's a config file somewhere but I'm not sure where"
```
**Expected:** Should use `file_search` (partial filename knowledge)

```bash
./prompt.sh "Show me the structure of the devops directory"
```
**Expected:** Should use `list_dir` (directory exploration)

#### Test 3.3: Code Context vs System Commands
```bash
./prompt.sh "How do other parts of this codebase handle similar functionality?"
```
**Expected:** Should use `retrieve_code_context_tool` (pattern understanding)

```bash
./prompt.sh "What's the current git status and recent commits?"
```
**Expected:** Should use `execute_shell_command` (system state)

### **Test 4: Information Discovery Hierarchy**
**Objective:** Verify the agent follows the proper discovery sequence

#### Test 4.1: Code Analysis First
```bash
./prompt.sh "How does authentication work in this system?"
```

**Expected Discovery Sequence:**
1. Query existing knowledge/context
2. Use codebase search and context retrieval  
3. Use system commands to check running state
4. Web search only as final fallback

#### Test 4.2: System State Queries
```bash
./prompt.sh "Is this project properly set up for development?"
```

**Expected Discovery Sequence:**
1. Check indexed codebase for setup files
2. Use system commands to check dependencies
3. Analyze configuration files
4. Provide comprehensive setup status

### **Test 5: Context Integration and Reference**
**Objective:** Verify the agent effectively uses and references provided context

#### Test 5.1: Specific Context Reference
```bash
./prompt.sh "What specific improvements were made to the context management system recently?"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should reference specific file names from context
- Should mention exact line numbers or code snippets
- Should connect current context to previous tool results
- Should build on existing conversation history

#### Test 5.2: Context Gap Identification
```bash
./prompt.sh "How does the deployment pipeline work for this project?"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Should use available context first
- Should clearly note if critical information is missing
- Should suggest specific tools or searches to fill gaps
- Should provide best-effort response based on available information

### **Test 6: Complex Workflow Integration**
**Objective:** Test end-to-end workflow with multiple prompt improvements

**Command:**
```bash
./prompt.sh "I want to understand and improve the error handling in this DevOps agent. Can you analyze the current approach, identify weaknesses, and suggest improvements?"
```

**Expected Comprehensive Behavior:**
1. **Context Usage:** Reference AGENT.md operational procedures
2. **Tool Sequencing:** Use optimized analysis workflow
3. **Discovery Hierarchy:** Follow proper information gathering sequence
4. **Specific References:** Extract and use specific context details
5. **Self-Sufficiency:** Use tools to find information before asking

## üìã Prompt Structure Validation

### **Verify Hierarchical Processing:**
The agent should demonstrate understanding of:

1. **EXECUTION PRIORITY DIRECTIVES** (highest priority)
2. **CONTEXT INTEGRATION STRATEGY** 
3. **TOOL SEQUENCING PATTERNS**
4. **TOOL SELECTION INTELLIGENCE**
5. **INFORMATION DISCOVERY HIERARCHY**

### **Context Block Processing:**
Look for evidence of:
- Extracting actionable data from JSON context
- Referencing specific file paths and line numbers
- Building incrementally on provided context
- Connecting patterns across conversation turns

## üîç Log Analysis Commands

```bash
# Monitor tool usage patterns
tail -f /var/folders/*/T/agents_log/agent.latest.log | grep -E "(Tool:|Using tool:|Executing)"

# Check context block usage
grep "SYSTEM CONTEXT" /var/folders/*/T/agents_log/agent.latest.log | tail -10

# Analyze decision-making patterns
grep -E "(Analyzing|Choosing|Selected)" /var/folders/*/T/agents_log/agent.latest.log | tail -20
```

- Asking questions instead of using tools
- Random tool selection without clear logic

**Inefficient Tool Usage:**
- Using grep for conceptual searches
- Using codebase_search for exact text matches
- Skipping logical tool sequences
- Not following established workflow patterns

**Weak Context Integration:**
- Generic responses without specific references
- Not connecting current context to previous results
- Missing obvious context details
- Failing to build on conversation history

**Decision Quality Issues:**
- Vague or non-actionable responses
- Missing obvious patterns or connections
- Not demonstrating understanding of project
- Ignoring operational context and procedures

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If prompt engineering fails:

1. **Check Prompt Loading:**
   ```bash
   grep -A 10 "EXECUTION PRIORITY DIRECTIVES" /var/folders/*/T/agents_log/agent.latest.log
   ```

2. **Verify Context Processing:**
   ```bash
   grep "Use this context to inform" /var/folders/*/T/agents_log/agent.latest.log
   ```

3. **Analyze Tool Selection Logic:**
   ```bash
   grep -B 2 -A 2 "Tool selection:" /var/folders/*/T/agents_log/agent.latest.log
   ```

4. **Check Decision Quality:**
   - Review actual responses for specificity
   - Verify context details are being referenced
   - Confirm tool sequences match expected patterns
