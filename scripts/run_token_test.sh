# Test phases
PROMPTS=(
    # Phase 1: Baseline (Turns 1-5)
    "What is this project about? Give me a high-level overview."
    "Show me the main agent implementation files and explain how they work together."
    "What configuration options are available for this DevOps agent?"
    "How does error handling work throughout the codebase? Show me the key error handling patterns."
    "Explain in detail how the context management system works, including token optimization strategies."
    
    # Phase 2: Context Accumulation (Turns 6-12)
    "Analyze the implementation of all Python files in the devops/ directory. What are the key components and how do they interact?"
    "Go through each tool in the tools/ directory and explain what it does, how it's integrated, and any performance considerations."
    "Examine the pyproject.toml, requirements, and overall project architecture. What are the main dependencies and how is the project structured?"
    "Look at the testing setup in tests/ directory and pytest.ini. How comprehensive is the test coverage and what testing strategies are used?"
    "Read through all the markdown files and documentation. What's documented well and what might be missing?"
    "Analyze all configuration files (.gitignore, .indexignore, config files) and explain the project's configuration strategy."
    "How does this agent integrate with external systems? Look for API integrations, external tool usage, and deployment configurations."
    
    # Phase 3: High-Load Scenarios (Turns 13-20)
    "I have a Kubernetes cluster with multiple applications running. Help me understand what's deployed and the current cluster health."
    "Check the status of all pods across all namespaces. Identify any that are not in Running state and investigate why."
    "Analyze resource usage across the cluster - CPU, memory, storage. Are there any resource constraints or inefficiencies?"
    "If there's a service mesh (Istio, Linkerd) deployed, analyze its configuration and health. Check for any networking issues."
    "I'm seeing issues with several applications: authentication service intermittent failures, database connectivity problems, and slow API responses. Help me troubleshoot systematically."
    "Analyze logs from the last hour across all applications. Look for error patterns, warnings, and any correlation between issues in different services."
    "Perform a comprehensive audit of all ConfigMaps, Secrets, and environment variables across the cluster. Check for security issues and configuration drift."
    "Based on everything we've discovered, provide a comprehensive performance optimization plan for the entire cluster and applications."
    
    # Phase 4: Stress Test (Turns 21-25)
    "I need a complete analysis of my production Kubernetes cluster including: all workloads, networking configuration, security policies, monitoring setup, backup strategies, disaster recovery procedures, resource utilization patterns, cost optimization opportunities, compliance status, and operational procedures. Be extremely thorough."
    "Look at the change history for the past month across all applications and infrastructure. Correlate any changes with performance issues or incidents. Provide a detailed timeline and impact analysis."
    "Compare configurations between development, staging, and production environments. Identify any drift, security differences, or potential issues. Recommend standardization strategies."
    "Perform a complete security audit of the entire infrastructure and applications. Check for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, exposed secrets, network security issues, RBAC problems, and compliance gaps."
    "Simulate a major incident where multiple services are failing. Walk through the complete incident response process including detection, investigation, mitigation, communication, and post-incident analysis."
