# PLAN_TEST_GROOM.md - Test Suite Organization and Maintainability Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a detailed plan for improving the organization and maintainability of our existing test suite. The goal is to enhance clarity, reduce redundancy, and ensure a scalable structure as the project evolves.

The plan is structured into a main feature, containing multiple milestones. Every milestone is designed to be independently testable and verifiable, ensuring a clear path for development and quality assurance. This document is intended to be accessible for junior developers, providing clear tasks and guidelines.

## General Implementation Guidelines

To ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability, all development efforts will adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Ensure unit tests are isolated and test individual functions/methods.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components.
*   **Regression Tests:** Ensure all existing tests (unit and integration) pass after implementing changes. Continuous integration will be used to enforce this.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Where applicable, consider writing tests before writing the code to guide development.

### 2. Code Quality & Standards

*   **Linter & Code Style:** Adhere strictly to the project's defined code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python). All code must pass linters (e.g., `uv run ruff check . --fix`, `uv run ruff format .`) without warnings or errors.
*   **Readability:** Write clean, self-documenting code with clear variable names, concise functions, and appropriate comments for complex logic.
*   **Performance:** Optimize code for performance where necessary, especially for operations involving file I/O or large data processing.

### 3. Documentation

*   **Inline Comments:** Use comments to explain non-obvious code sections.
*   **Docstrings:** Provide clear and concise docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules, describing their purpose, arguments, and return values.
*   **Test Documentation:** Update `README.md` files within test directories to reflect new conventions and guidelines.

### 4. Version Control Best Practices

*   **Feature Branches:** All development for a new feature or milestone will be done on a dedicated feature branch.
*   **Atomic Commits:** Make small, focused commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   **Code Reviews:** All pull requests will undergo code review by at least one other developer before merging into the main branch.

### 5. Milestone Completion & Verification

*   No milestone will be started until all prior milestones and their tasks are FULLY completed, pass all linters, and pass all existing and new tests.
*   Each milestone includes specific "Verification Steps" that can be followed to confirm the successful implementation.

        - `context_management/` - Context awareness and management tests (6 files)
        - `workflows/` - Workflow orchestration tests (4 files)
        - `optimization/` - Performance and proactive optimization tests (5 files)
        - `tools_system/` - Tool orchestration and system integration tests (4 files)
        - `performance/` - Performance and load testing (1 file)
    *   âœ… **COMPLETED:** Moved 27 test files into appropriate subdirectories with `__init__.py` files.
*   - [x] **Task 1.1.3: Update `README.md` in `tests/integration`:**
    *   âœ… **COMPLETED:** Created comprehensive `tests/integration/README.md` documenting:
        - Complete directory structure and test organization
        - Feature-based naming conventions (`test_<feature>_integration.py`)
        - Instructions for running tests by category
        - Contributing guidelines for new tests
        - Test execution commands and troubleshooting

**Verification Steps:**

1.  âœ… **VERIFIED:** No integration test files are named using "milestone" references (0 files found).
2.  âœ… **VERIFIED:** New subdirectories within `tests/integration` logically group related tests by feature.
3.  âœ… **VERIFIED:** `tests/integration/README.md` accurately reflects the updated organization and naming conventions.
