# PLAN_TEST_GROOM.md - Test Suite Organization and Maintainability Plan

## Introduction

This document outlines a detailed plan for improving the organization and maintainability of our existing test suite. The goal is to enhance clarity, reduce redundancy, and ensure a scalable structure as the project evolves.

The plan is structured into a main feature, containing multiple milestones. Every milestone is designed to be independently testable and verifiable, ensuring a clear path for development and quality assurance. This document is intended to be accessible for junior developers, providing clear tasks and guidelines.

## General Implementation Guidelines

To ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability, all development efforts will adhere to the following guidelines:

### 1. Testing Strategy

*   **Unit Tests:** Ensure unit tests are isolated and test individual functions/methods.
*   **Integration Tests:** Verify interactions between components.
*   **Regression Tests:** Ensure all existing tests (unit and integration) pass after implementing changes. Continuous integration will be used to enforce this.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Where applicable, consider writing tests before writing the code to guide development.

### 2. Code Quality & Standards

*   **Linter & Code Style:** Adhere strictly to the project's defined code style guidelines (e.g., PEP 8 for Python). All code must pass linters (e.g., `uv run ruff check . --fix`, `uv run ruff format .`) without warnings or errors.
*   **Readability:** Write clean, self-documenting code with clear variable names, concise functions, and appropriate comments for complex logic.
*   **Performance:** Optimize code for performance where necessary, especially for operations involving file I/O or large data processing.

### 3. Documentation

*   **Inline Comments:** Use comments to explain non-obvious code sections.
*   **Docstrings:** Provide clear and concise docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules, describing their purpose, arguments, and return values.
*   **Test Documentation:** Update `README.md` files within test directories to reflect new conventions and guidelines.

### 4. Version Control Best Practices

*   **Feature Branches:** All development for a new feature or milestone will be done on a dedicated feature branch.
*   **Atomic Commits:** Make small, focused commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
*   **Code Reviews:** All pull requests will undergo code review by at least one other developer before merging into the main branch.

### 5. Milestone Completion & Verification

*   No milestone will be started until all prior milestones and their tasks are FULLY completed, pass all linters, and pass all existing and new tests.
*   Each milestone includes specific "Verification Steps" that can be followed to confirm the successful implementation.

## Feature: Test Suite Organization and Maintainability

**Goal:** Refine the existing test suite's structure to improve clarity, consistency, and long-term maintainability, making it easier for developers to navigate, understand, and contribute to tests.

### Milestone 1.1: Standardize Integration Test Naming and Sub-categorization

**Objective:** Ensure integration tests are named consistently based on features/components and are logically grouped into subdirectories where appropriate.

**Tasks:**

*   - [ ] **Task 1.1.1: Rename Milestone-Based Integration Tests:**
    *   Identify all integration test files currently named after milestones (e.g., `test_proactive_error_detection_milestone_2_1.py`) and rename them to feature-based names.
    *   Rename these files to reflect the feature or component interaction they test (e.g., `test_proactive_error_detection_integration.py` or `test_error_handling_integration.py`).
    *   **Implementation Note:** Ensure all references to these files (e.g., in CI/CD scripts, documentation) are updated.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.1.2: Identify and Create New Subdirectories for Logical Grouping:**
    *   Analyze the `tests/integration` directory for groups of tests that could benefit from further sub-categorization (e.g., tests for a specific agent, a particular workflow, or a major system component).
    *   Create new subdirectories within `tests/integration` (e.g., `tests/integration/agents`, `tests/integration/workflows`).
    *   Move relevant test files into these new subdirectories.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.1.3: Update `README.md` in `tests/integration`:**
    *   Revise `tests/integration/README.md` to document the new naming conventions and the purpose of any new subdirectories.
    *   Provide examples of how to structure new integration tests.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Verify that no integration test files are named using "milestone" references.
2.  Confirm that new subdirectories within `tests/integration` logically group related tests.
3.  Check that `tests/integration/README.md` accurately reflects the updated organization and naming conventions.
4.  Run all integration tests to ensure no paths were broken by renaming/moving files.

### Milestone 1.2: Optimize `conftest.py` Usage

**Objective:** Review and refine the placement and content of `conftest.py` files to ensure fixtures are appropriately scoped and documented.

**Tasks:**

*   - [ ] **Task 1.2.1: Audit Existing `conftest.py` Files for Duplication and Scope:**
    *   Examine `tests/conftest.py` and `tests/integration/conftest.py` (and any others found).
    *   Identify any fixtures that are duplicated or could be more appropriately scoped to a specific subdirectory.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.2.2: Relocate Fixtures to Appropriate Scopes:**
    *   Move fixtures that are only used by unit tests into `tests/unit/conftest.py` (if it exists, or create it).
    *   Move fixtures specific to a new integration subdirectory into a `conftest.py` within that subdirectory.
    *   Ensure `tests/conftest.py` only contains truly global fixtures.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.2.3: Document Complex Fixtures:**
    *   Add clear docstrings to all fixtures, especially those with complex setup/teardown logic or specific dependencies.
    *   Explain their purpose, parameters, and what they provide.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Verify that fixtures are placed in the most appropriate `conftest.py` file based on their usage scope.
2.  Confirm that there is no unnecessary duplication of fixtures across `conftest.py` files.
3.  Check that all complex fixtures have clear and concise docstrings.
4.  Run all tests (unit and integration) to ensure fixture resolution is still correct.

### Milestone 1.3: Centralize Test Utilities and Shared Components

**Objective:** Create a dedicated directory for reusable test utility functions, helpers, and shared test data to promote the DRY principle and improve test readability.

**Tasks:**

*   - [ ] **Task 1.3.1: Identify Common Utility Functions/Helpers:**
    *   Scan existing test files (unit, integration, e2e) for functions or classes that are repeatedly defined or could be generalized and reused.
    *   Look for common setup/teardown patterns that are not yet fixtures.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.3.2: Create `tests/utils` or `tests/shared` Directory:**
    *   Create a new directory, e.g., `tests/utils/` (or `tests/shared/`), at the root of the `tests/` directory.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.3.3: Move Identified Utilities to the New Directory:**
    *   Refactor and move the identified common utility functions, helper classes, and shared test data into modules within the new `tests/utils/` directory.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.3.4: Update Imports in Existing Tests:**
    *   Modify all existing test files to import these utilities from their new centralized location.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Verify the existence of the `tests/utils/` (or `tests/shared/`) directory containing reusable test components.
2.  Confirm that common utility functions are no longer duplicated across individual test files.
3.  Run all tests to ensure that imports are correctly updated and all tests still pass.

### Milestone 1.4: Enhance Test Documentation

**Objective:** Improve the clarity, completeness, and accessibility of documentation for the test suite, guiding developers on how to contribute and maintain tests effectively.

**Tasks:**

*   - [ ] **Task 1.4.1: Update `README.md` in `tests/` and `tests/integration/`:**
    *   Review and expand the `README.md` files in `tests/` and `tests/integration/` to provide a comprehensive overview of the test suite.
    *   Include sections on:
        *   Purpose of each test type (unit, integration, e2e, performance).
        *   General guidelines for writing tests.
        *   How to run tests (all, specific files, specific types).
        *   How to generate and view coverage reports.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.4.2: Add Guidelines for New Test Contributions:**
    *   Create a dedicated section or document (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING_TESTS.md` if extensive, or within existing READMEs) outlining best practices for adding new tests.
    *   Cover topics like:
        *   Choosing the correct test type.
        *   Naming conventions for test files and functions.
        *   Using fixtures and shared utilities.
        *   Mocking external dependencies.
*   - [ ] **Task 1.4.3: Document Test Execution Commands and Coverage:**
    *   Clearly document the exact shell commands required to run all tests, specific test files, and to generate code coverage reports.
    *   Include instructions on how to interpret coverage reports.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  Verify that the `README.md` files in `tests/` and `tests/integration/` are up-to-date and provide comprehensive information.
2.  Confirm that guidelines for new test contributions are clear and easy to follow.
3.  Check that test execution and coverage commands are accurately documented and work as described.
4.  Conduct a peer review of the updated documentation to ensure clarity and completeness for new contributors.
