"""
Integration tests for enhanced agent feature parity.

This test module ensures that the enhanced sub-agents maintain functionality
while using an efficient approach that avoids code duplication:
- Factory functions for some agents (code_review, testing)
- Tool reuse for others (avoiding re-computation)
- Unique names to prevent parent conflicts

These tests prevent regressions in the core functionality without requiring
the original heavy duplication approach.
