# Plan: Enhancing Software Engineer Capabilities with Semantic Code and VCS Tools

## 1. Introduction

This plan outlines the development of advanced capabilities for the `enhanced_software_engineer` agent, focusing on semantic code understanding, intelligent refactoring, enhanced code navigation, and deeper integration with Version Control Systems (VCS). These improvements aim to transform the agent from a file-manipulator and basic code analyst into a more intelligent, context-aware assistant capable of performing and assisting with complex software development tasks, thereby significantly improving developer productivity and code quality.

## 2. Feature Breakdown and Implementation Plan

### Feature 1: Semantic Code Understanding & Automated Refactoring

**Description:** This feature aims to enable the agent to understand code at a semantic level (beyond just text or syntax errors) by leveraging Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and language-specific parsers. This understanding will facilitate intelligent, guaranteed-correct refactoring operations that update all relevant code references across the project.

#### Milestone 1.1: Core Language Parsing & AST Generation

*   **Goal:** Establish the foundational capability to parse code files into their Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representations.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1.1.1: Integrate Python AST Parser:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Utilize Python's built-in `ast` module or a robust third-party library (e.g., `libCST` for concrete syntax trees, which preserve formatting). Develop a tool function (`parse_python_code_to_ast`) that takes Python file content and returns its AST representation.
    *   **Task 1.1.2: Integrate JavaScript/TypeScript AST Parser:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Explore and integrate a JavaScript/TypeScript parser (e.g., `esprima`, `babel parser`, or leveraging LSP capabilities if available). Develop a tool function (`parse_js_ts_code_to_ast`) for these languages.
    *   **Task 1.1.3: AST Serialization/Deserialization:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Implement methods to serialize ASTs to a format (e.g., JSON) that can be stored in session state or passed between tools, and deserialize them back for manipulation.

#### Milestone 1.2: Cross-File Symbol Resolution & Scoping

*   **Goal:** Develop the ability to resolve symbols (variables, functions, classes) and understand their scope and definitions across multiple files within a project.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1.2.1: Implement Symbol Table Generation:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Create a tool (`build_symbol_table`) that traverses the ASTs of all relevant project files to build a comprehensive symbol table, mapping symbol names to their definitions and locations. This table should handle imports/exports.
    *   **Task 1.2.2: Implement Cross-File Reference Tracking:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Extend the symbol table or create a new mechanism (`track_references`) to identify all occurrences (references) of a given symbol across the entire codebase, linking them back to their definition.
    *   **Task 1.2.3: Basic Scope Analysis:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Ensure the symbol resolution correctly handles lexical scoping rules for different programming languages (e.g., local variables, global variables, function scope, class scope).

#### Milestone 1.3: Automated Refactoring Operations

*   **Goal:** Develop tools that can perform common refactoring patterns, automatically updating code while preserving correctness.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1.3.1: Implement `rename_symbol` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Create a tool (`rename_symbol(old_name, new_name, scope=project/file/function)`) that uses the symbol table and reference tracking to identify all occurrences of a symbol and modify them consistently. This tool should generate a set of `edit_file` operations or a multi-file patch for approval.
    *   **Task 1.3.2: Implement `extract_function/method` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Develop a tool (`extract_function(filepath, start_line, end_line, new_function_name)`) that takes a selection of code, extracts it into a new function/method, replaces the original selection with a call to the new function, and correctly handles parameter passing and return values. This is complex and might be a future iteration after basic renaming.
    *   **Task 1.3.3: Implement `move_file_or_module` Tool (with import updates):**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Extend `move_file` to automatically update import statements in all affected files when a module or file is moved to a new location. This requires dependency analysis.

### Feature 2: Advanced Code Navigation and Querying

**Description:** This feature provides capabilities to programmatically navigate and query the codebase based on semantic understanding, similar to features found in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

#### Milestone 2.1: Go-to Definition & Find All References

*   **Goal:** Enable quick navigation to symbol definitions and listing all their usages.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 2.1.1: Implement `go_to_definition` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Create a tool (`go_to_definition(filepath, line, column)`) that takes a code location, identifies the symbol at that point, and returns the file path and line/column of its definition, leveraging the symbol table.
    *   **Task 2.1.2: Implement `find_all_references` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Create a tool (`find_all_references(filepath, line, column)`) that returns a list of all locations (filepath, line, column) where a given symbol is referenced, using the cross-file reference tracking.

#### Milestone 2.2: Semantic Code Search & Querying

*   **Goal:** Allow searching the codebase based on structural and semantic criteria, not just text patterns.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 2.2.1: Implement `semantic_search_code` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Develop a tool (`semantic_search_code(query_type, query_details)`) that can query for specific code constructs. Examples:
            *   `query_type="function_signature"`, `query_details="name=read_data, params=[string, int], returns=dict"`
            *   `query_type="class_inheritance"`, `query_details="inherits_from=BaseClass"`
            *   This would require extending the AST analysis and symbol table to tag elements with more detailed semantic information.

### Feature 3: Integrated Version Control System (VCS) Operations

**Description:** This feature will allow the agent to directly interact with the project's Git repository, enabling it to stage changes, create commits, and manage branches, thereby integrating more smoothly into typical developer workflows.

#### Milestone 3.1: Basic Git Operations

*   **Goal:** Enable the agent to perform fundamental Git actions.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 3.1.1: Implement `git_status` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Use `execute_shell_command` internally for `git status` to show untracked, modified, and staged files. Provide a structured output.
    *   **Task 3.1.2: Implement `git_add` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Use `execute_shell_command` for `git add <files>`. Allow adding specific files or all changes.
    *   **Task 3.1.3: Implement `git_commit` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Use `execute_shell_command` for `git commit -m "message"`. Ensure commit messages can be generated by the agent or provided by the user.

#### Milestone 3.2: Branch Management

*   **Goal:** Allow the agent to manage branches within the repository.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 3.2.1: Implement `git_branch` Tool (list/create/switch):**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Wrap `git branch` (list), `git branch <name>` (create), and `git checkout <name>` (switch) using `execute_shell_command`.
    *   **Task 3.2.2: Implement `git_merge` Tool (basic):**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Wrap `git merge <branch>` for simple merges, acknowledging that conflict resolution would be a separate, more complex feature.

#### Milestone 3.3: Advanced Git Operations (Future Considerations)

*   **Goal:** Explore more complex Git operations for a fully autonomous workflow.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 3.3.1: Implement `git_diff` Tool:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** Generate detailed diffs for specific files or the entire working tree using `git diff`.
    *   **Task 3.3.2: Implement `git_push/pull` Tools (with authentication considerations):**
        *   **Implementation Details:** This would be a significant undertaking due to authentication requirements and potential for conflicts. It would likely require careful design regarding security and user interaction for credentials.
    *   **Task 3.3.3: Conflict Resolution Assistance:**
        *   **Implementation Details:** A very advanced feature to detect merge conflicts and potentially suggest or automatically apply resolutions for simple cases, or guide the user through complex ones.

## 3. General Considerations & Cross-Cutting Concerns

*   **Performance:** AST parsing and whole-project analysis can be resource-intensive. Solutions must be optimized for performance, potentially using caching or incremental analysis.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling is crucial for all new tools, especially for refactoring and VCS operations where incorrect actions can lead to data loss or broken code.
*   **Approval Workflow:** For destructive or wide-ranging changes (e.g., cross-file renames, automated commits), leveraging or extending the existing approval mechanism will be critical.
*   **Language Agnostic vs. Language Specific:** While some concepts are general, the actual implementation of AST parsing and semantic understanding will be highly language-specific. Prioritize languages based on project needs (e.g., Python first, then JavaScript/TypeScript).
*   **Integration with Existing Tools:** New tools should seamlessly integrate with existing file system and code quality tools, potentially using their outputs as inputs or triggering them post-modification.
*   **User Feedback and Transparency:** For automated refactoring and VCS operations, clear communication of *what* changes are being made and *why* is paramount. Show diffs and summaries before execution.
*   **Safety and Idempotency:** Operations should be designed to be safe and, where possible, idempotent (running them multiple times has the same effect as running them once).

This detailed plan provides a roadmap for significantly enhancing the `enhanced_software_engineer` agent, enabling it to handle more sophisticated and integrated development tasks.
