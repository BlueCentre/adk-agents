# Phase 2 Advanced Features Implementation

**Date:** December 23, 2024  
**Features:** Smart Prioritization & Cross-turn Correlation  
**Status:** Implementation Complete - Ready for Validation  

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This document details the implementation of the remaining Phase 2 features:
1. **Smart Prioritization** - Relevance-based snippet ranking
2. **Cross-turn Correlation** - Linking related code or tool results across turns

These features build upon the successful **Proactive Context Addition** to create a more intelligent and coherent context management system.

## âœ… Feature 1: Smart Prioritization

### **Implementation Details**

**Module:** `devops/components/context_management/smart_prioritization.py`

**Purpose:** Intelligently rank code snippets and tool results based on multiple relevance factors instead of simple recency/frequency sorting.

### **Scoring Components**

1. **Content Relevance (35% weight):**
   - Keyword matching with current conversation context
   - High-value keyword detection (config, setup, main, etc.)
   - File type relevance scoring
   - Code pattern recognition (functions, classes, imports)

2. **Recency Score (25% weight):**
   - Turn-based decay function
   - Higher scores for recently accessed items
   - Exponential decay over 20 turns

3. **Frequency Score (15% weight):**
   - Based on accumulated relevance from previous accesses
   - Normalized to 0-1 range

4. **Error Priority (15% weight):**
   - Higher priority for error-related content
   - Keyword detection for error terms
   - Special handling for debugging contexts

5. **Context Coherence (10% weight):**
   - File type and location relevance
   - Directory structure analysis
   - Configuration file bonuses

### **Integration Points**

- **Code Snippets:** Integrated into `ContextManager.assemble_context()` 
- **Tool Results:** Applied after collecting tool result dictionaries
- **Logging:** Comprehensive debug logging with score breakdowns

### **Expected Benefits**

- More relevant context selection
- Better handling of error scenarios
- Improved code-to-documentation correlation
- Reduced "noise" from irrelevant old snippets

## âœ… Feature 2: Cross-turn Correlation

### **Implementation Details**

**Module:** `devops/components/context_management/cross_turn_correlation.py`

**Purpose:** Identify and link related items across conversation turns to maintain narrative coherence and help LLM understand project workflows.

### **Correlation Types**

1. **File Similarity (30% weight):**
   - Exact file matches (1.0 score)
   - Same directory (0.7 score)
   - Same file type group (0.5 score)
   - Same filename, different path (0.6 score)

2. **Content Similarity (25% weight):**
   - Jaccard similarity on keywords
   - Code pattern matching (functions, classes, imports)
   - Bonus for shared programming constructs

3. **Temporal Proximity (20% weight):**
   - Turn distance decay function
   - Higher scores for items close in time
   - Same turn (1.0) to 20+ turns apart (0.1)

4. **Tool Sequence Correlation (15% weight):**
   - Recognizes common tool operation patterns
   - `read_file` â†’ `edit_file` sequences
   - `execute_command` â†’ `read_file` workflows
   - Tool family groupings (file ops, search ops)

5. **Error Continuation (10% weight):**
   - Links errors to their resolutions
   - Sequential error patterns
   - Error â†’ successful operation chains

### **Correlation Graph Structure**

- **Snippet-to-Snippet:** Links related code across files/turns
- **Tool-to-Tool:** Links related operations and workflows  
- **Cross-correlations:** Links code snippets to relevant tool operations

### **Metadata Enrichment**

Each context item receives correlation metadata:
```python
{
    '_correlations': {
        'count': 3,                    # Number of related items
        'max_score': 0.847,           # Highest correlation score
        'related_indices': [1, 4, 7], # Indices of related items
        'scores': {1: 0.847, 4: 0.623, 7: 0.445}
    },
    '_cross_correlations': {
        'tools': [                     # Related tools (for snippets)
            {'tool_index': 2, 'score': 0.723, 'file_similarity': 1.0}
        ]
    }
}
```

### **Expected Benefits**

- Better narrative coherence across turns
- Improved error resolution tracking
- Enhanced file-based workflow understanding
- More intelligent context clustering

## ðŸ”§ Integration Architecture

### **Processing Pipeline**

1. **Context Collection:** Gather code snippets and tool results
2. **Smart Prioritization:** Apply relevance-based ranking
3. **Cross-turn Correlation:** Analyze relationships and add metadata
4. **Token Budget Allocation:** Include items based on priority and correlations
5. **Assembly:** Build final context with enhanced metadata

### **Performance Considerations**

- **Lazy Evaluation:** Correlations calculated only when needed
- **Threshold Filtering:** Only meaningful correlations (>0.1 score) stored
- **Memory Efficient:** Uses dictionaries instead of object graphs
- **Configurable Weights:** Easy tuning of scoring factors

### **Logging and Debugging**

Both features include comprehensive logging:
- Score breakdowns for each item
- Top-ranked items summary
- Correlation statistics
- Performance metrics

## ðŸ§ª Validation Strategy

### **Test Scenarios**

1. **File-based Workflows:**
   - Test reading â†’ editing â†’ testing sequences
   - Verify cross-file correlations
   - Check configuration file prioritization

2. **Error Resolution Chains:**
   - Test error â†’ debugging â†’ resolution sequences
   - Verify error priority scoring
   - Check error continuation linking

3. **Project Structure Understanding:**
   - Test related file discovery
   - Verify directory-based correlations
   - Check tool sequence recognition

4. **Content Relevance:**
   - Test keyword-based prioritization
   - Verify content similarity scoring
   - Check code pattern recognition

### **Expected Validation Results**

- **Token Utilization:** Should maintain ~1.7% while improving relevance
