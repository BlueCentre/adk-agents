# DevOps Agent v2 - RAG Enhanced

This version of the DevOps agent includes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to enhance its ability to work with and understand codebases.

## RAG Implementation Summary

The RAG pipeline is implemented in the `rag_components/` subdirectory and consists of three main Python modules:

1.  **`rag_components/chunking.py`**:
    *   Responsible for breaking down source code files into smaller, meaningful chunks.
    *   Currently implements a chunking strategy for Python files (`.py`) using the `ast` module to identify functions, classes, and module-level code blocks.
    *   Non-Python files are treated as a single chunk by default.
    *   Outputs a list of dictionaries, each containing the chunk\'s content and metadata (file path, chunk name, type, start/end lines).

2.  **`rag_components/indexing.py`**:
    *   Takes the chunks produced by `chunking.py`.
    *   Generates semantic vector embeddings for the content of each chunk using Google\'s `text-embedding-004` model (via the `google-genai` library).
    *   Stores these embeddings, along with the chunk content and metadata, in a persistent vector database using ChromaDB.
    *   ChromaDB data is stored locally in `rag_components/chroma_data/`.
    *   The collection name in ChromaDB is `devops_codebase_index_v2` (updated due to library changes).

3.  **`rag_components/retriever.py`**:
    *   Takes a user query (string).
    *   Generates an embedding for the query using the same Google embedding model (with `task_type="RETRIEVAL_QUERY"` via the `google-genai` library).
    *   Queries the ChromaDB collection to find the `top_k` most semantically similar chunks to the query.
    *   Returns a list of the retrieved chunks, including their content, metadata, and similarity distance.

## Requirements

To use and test this RAG-enhanced agent, you will need:

1.  **Python Environment**: Python 3.8+ is recommended (due to `ast.get_source_segment`). The agent is typically run using `uvx` with a specified Python version (e.g., 3.11, 3.13).
2.  **Dependencies (Managed by `pyproject.toml` and `uv`)**:
    *   The required Python libraries (`chromadb` and `google-genai`) are declared in the `pyproject.toml` file located in the `/Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/` directory.
    *   When you run the agent using a command like `uvx ... adk run Agents/devops_v2`, `uv` will automatically detect `pyproject.toml` and install these dependencies into the isolated environment it creates for the agent. You do not need to `pip install` them manually.
    *   The current dependencies as specified in `pyproject.toml` are:
        *   `chromadb~=1.0.8`
        *   `google-genai~=1.14.0`
3.  **Google API Key**:
    *   You need a valid Google API key with permissions for the "Generative Language API" (which provides the embedding models).
    *   This API key **must** be set as an environment variable:
        ```bash
        export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    *   The agent scripts (`indexing.py` and `retriever.py`) will look for this environment variable.

## How to Validate the Solution

You can validate the RAG components by running the scripts directly from the `/Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/rag_components/` directory.

**1. Test Chunking (Optional Standalone Test):**

   You can examine how `chunking.py` processes a Python file:
   ```bash
   uv run python /Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/rag_components/chunking.py
   ```
   This will run the example `if __name__ == \'__main__\':` block in `chunking.py` and print out how a sample Python code string is chunked.

**2. Index Files:**

   *   Ensure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in your environment.
   *   Run the `indexing.py` script. The example in its `if __name__ == \'__main__\':` block will:
        *   Initialize the ChromaDB client and collection (data stored in `rag_components/chroma_data/`, collection name `devops_codebase_index_v2`).
        *   Index a few sample hardcoded chunks.
        *   You can modify this example to point to actual Python files you want to index. For example, to index a file named `my_script.py` located in `/Users/james/Workspace/project-alpha/`:
            1.  Modify `indexing.py`\'s main block to read `my_script.py`.
            2.  Use `chunk_file_content` from `chunking.py` to get chunks.
            3.  Pass these chunks to `index_file_chunks`.

   Example command to run the built-in indexing example:
   ```bash
   uv run --with google-genai --with google-api-core --with chromadb python /Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/rag_components/indexing.py
   ```
   Observe the log output for success messages or errors. After running, you should see data populated in the `rag_components/chroma_data/` directory.

**3. Retrieve Chunks:**

   *   Ensure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set.
   *   Make sure you have indexed some data in the previous step (into the `devops_codebase_index_v2` collection).
   *   Run the `retriever.py` script. The example in its `if __name__ == \'__main__\':` block will:
        *   Attempt to retrieve chunks relevant to sample queries like "How does MyClass work?" and "tell me about helpers".
        *   Print the retrieved chunks, their metadata, and similarity scores.

   Example command:
   ```bash
   uv run --with google-genai --with google-api-core --with chromadb --with protobuf==3.20.3 python /Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/rag_components/retriever.py
   ```
   Check if the output shows relevant chunks based on the sample data indexed by `indexing.py`.

## ADK Agent Integration

The RAG pipeline components (`chunking.py`, `indexing.py`, `retriever.py`) are integrated into the DevOps Agent v2 as ADK tools, allowing the agent to leverage these capabilities. Here\'s how it was done:

1.  **New RAG Tools (`tools/rag_tools.py`):**
    *   A new file `/Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/tools/rag_tools.py` was created.
    *   It defines two ADK-compatible tools using the `@tool_utils.tool_validator` decorator:
        *   `index_directory_tool(directory_path: str, file_extensions: list[str] = None, force_reindex: bool = False) -> str`:
            *   Scans the specified `directory_path` for files matching `file_extensions` (defaults to `.py`).
            *   Uses `rag_components.chunking` to break files into chunks.
            *   Uses `rag_components.indexing` to generate embeddings and store them in the ChromaDB collection (`devops_codebase_index_v2`).
            *   Includes a basic `force_reindex` capability to attempt deletion of old chunks for a file before re-indexing.
            *   Returns a summary string of the indexing operation.
        *   `retrieve_code_context_tool(query: str, top_k: int = 5) -> dict | str`:
            *   Takes a natural language `query`.
            *   Uses `rag_components.retriever` to get the `top_k` most relevant chunks from the indexed codebase.
            *   Returns a dictionary containing the query and the list of retrieved chunks (with metadata, content, and distance) or an error string.

2.  **Tool Discovery (`tools/__init__.py`):**
    *   The `/Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/tools/__init__.py` file was updated to:
        *   Import the `rag_tools` module (`from . import rag_tools`).
        *   Explicitly import and expose `index_directory_tool` and `retrieve_code_context_tool` from `.rag_tools`.
        *   Add these tool names to the `__all__` list for easier importing.

3.  **Agent Tool Registration (`agent.py`):**
    *   In `/Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/agent.py`:
        *   The `index_directory_tool` and `retrieve_code_context_tool` are imported from `.tools`.
        *   These imported tool functions are added to the `devops_core_tools` list, making them available to the `LlmAgent`.

4.  **Agent Prompt Enhancement (`prompt.py`):**
    *   The main agent instruction string (`DEVOPS_AGENT_INSTR`) in `/Users/james/Agents/devops_v2/prompt.py` was updated to:
        *   Inform the agent about its new "Codebase Indexing" and "Contextual Retrieval" capabilities.
        *   Provide a suggested workflow for using these tools when dealing with code-related questions or tasks, encouraging it to check for existing indexes, offer to index new codebases, and use retrieval for contextual understanding.

With these changes, the agent can now be instructed to index directories and retrieve context from the indexed data using natural language commands, which will trigger the respective ADK tools.

## Future Improvements

*   **Automated Re-indexing via File Watcher:**
    *   To ensure the codebase index remains consistently up-to-date, a future enhancement could involve implementing an automated re-indexing mechanism.
    *   This would ideally involve an external file watcher service that monitors indexed directories for changes (creations, modifications, deletions).
    *   Upon detecting a change, this service would automatically trigger the re-indexing process for the affected files/directories, ensuring the ChromaDB vector store reflects the latest state of the codebase without manual intervention. This would decouple the watching mechanism from the agent\'s lifecycle, making it more robust.


## Prompt References

* "Hi! Please re-index the Agents/devops/ directory. Use the following file extensions: .py, .md, .txt, .sh, .yaml, .yml, .json, .tf, .hcl, and .go. Make sure to force re-indexing. After it's done, please tell me the summary message, especially the part about how many files and directories were ignored based on the .indexignore rules."
