# PLAN_TUI_FEATURES.md: Enhanced TUI Interface Recommendations

## Overview

This document outlines a detailed plan for enhancing the Text User Interface (TUI) to be both visually appealing and highly functional for software engineers. The goal is to create a TUI experience that rivals or even surpasses some Integrated Development Environment (IDE) features within the terminal environment, providing powerful, integrated functionalities and a clear, intuitive user experience.

## I. Visual Appeal and Usability Enhancements

These features focus on the aesthetic and interactive aspects to make the TUI pleasant and easy to use.

### A. Thoughtful Color Schemes and Theming

*   **Goal:** Provide clear visual cues and customization options for users.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 1.1: Define Semantic Color Palette:**
        *   Establish a core set of colors for success, error, warning, info, active elements, selected items, and default text/background.
        *   *Hint:* Use a few accent colors against a neutral background.
    *   **Task 1.2: Implement Syntax Highlighting:**
        *   Integrate a syntax highlighting library for displaying code (e.g., `Pygments` for Python, `tree-sitter` bindings if available for richer parsing).
        *   *Hint:* Map syntax tokens to the defined semantic color palette.
    *   **Task 1.3: Develop Theme Switcher:**
        *   Allow users to toggle between predefined light/dark themes.
        *   Consider a configuration option for custom color overrides.
        *   *Hint:* Store themes as dictionaries mapping UI elements/syntax tokens to color codes.
*   **Implementation Hints:**
    *   Leverage TUI libraries (e.g., `Textual`, `Rich`, `Urwid`, `curses`) that offer robust styling and theming capabilities.
    *   CSS-like styling (e.g., `Textual`'s CSS) can simplify theme management.

### B. Clean Layouts and Dynamic Panels

*   **Goal:** Create a structured, uncluttered, and adaptable interface.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 2.1: Implement Multi-Panel Layout System:**
        *   Allow users to define and save panel layouts (e.g., file tree on left, editor in center, console at bottom).
        *   Enable panels to be resized, hidden, or swapped.
        *   *Hint:* Use split panes or container widgets provided by the TUI library.
    *   **Task 2.2: Consistent Borders and Separators:**
        *   Apply consistent character-based borders (e.g., `─`, `│`, `┌`, `└`) around all panels and interactive elements.
        *   *Hint:* Most TUI libraries offer border drawing utilities.
    *   **Task 2.3: Contextual Information Display:**
        *   Implement logic to show/hide panels or switch content based on the user's current context (e.g., if a file is open, show the editor; if tests run, show the test output panel).
        *   *Hint:* Use a state management system to drive UI rendering.

### C. Interactive Elements and Feedback

*   **Goal:** Provide clear and immediate feedback for user actions and background processes.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 3.1: Progress Indicators:**
        *   Implement animated spinners for short operations.
        *   Develop progress bars for longer-running tasks (e.g., code analysis, test execution).
        *   *Hint:* Integrate with asynchronous operations to update indicators.
    *   **Task 3.2: Smart Input Prompts and Autocompletion:**
        *   Create input fields that offer contextual autocompletion for commands, file paths, and known entities (e.g., Git branches, function names).
        *   *Hint:* Use fuzzy matching algorithms for autocompletion.
    *   **Task 3.3: Persistent Status Bar:**
        *   Design a dedicated area at the bottom to display dynamic information like current mode, active file, Git branch, success/error messages.
        *   *Hint:* This should be a small, non-intrusive, and always visible component.

## II. "Blow Away" Features for a Software Engineer

These features aim to provide powerful, integrated developer tools directly within the TUI.

        *   Integrate with external linters (e.g., `Ruff`, `ESLint`).
        *   Run linters in the background and display errors/warnings as overlays or directly on lines within the editor panel.
        *   *Hint:* Use file system watchers to trigger linting on save or on a timer.
    *   **Task 5.2: Test Runner Integration with Live Results:**
        *   Execute unit/integration tests (e.g., `pytest`, `jest`).
        *   Display results (pass/fail counts, detailed tracebacks for failures) in a dedicated TUI panel.
        *   Allow navigation to source code of failing tests.
        *   *Hint:* Capture and parse the output of test runners.
    *   **Task 5.3: Performance Metrics Overlay (for running commands):**
        *   For `execute_shell_command` or similar, show real-time CPU/memory usage of the process, or elapsed time.
        *   *Hint:* Use `psutil` or similar OS-level tools to monitor processes.

### C. Intelligent Code Navigation and Search

*   **Goal:** Enable rapid movement and information retrieval within the codebase.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 6.1: Fuzzy File/Directory Search:**
        *   Implement a command palette (`Ctrl+P` or similar) that allows fuzzy searching for any file or directory in the project and quickly opening it.
        *   *Hint:* Adapt `fzf` principles; pre-index file paths for speed.
    *   **Task 6.2: Symbol Search (Go to Definition/References):**
        *   Integrate with Language Server Protocol (LSP) clients or static analysis tools to provide "go to definition" and "find all references" functionality.
        *   *Hint:* This is highly language-dependent. Start with one language.
    *   **Task 6.3: Powerful Grep/Ripgrep Integration:**
        *   Create a dedicated search panel.
        *   As the user types, show live `ripgrep` results with context snippets.
        *   Allow jumping to the matched lines in the respective files.
        *   *Hint:* Run `ripgrep` as a subprocess and stream its output.

### D. Integrated Debugging Capabilities (Basic)

*   **Goal:** Provide essential debugging functions within the TUI.

        *   Allow setting/clearing breakpoints via keyboard shortcuts.
    *   **Task 7.2: Step-through Execution:**
        *   Implement basic debugger controls: step over, step into, step out, continue.
    *   **Task 7.3: Variable Inspection:**
        *   Display local and global variables in a dedicated panel when execution is paused at a breakpoint.
        *   *Hint:* For Python, integrate with `pdb` or `debugpy`. This is a significant undertaking.

### E. AI-Assisted Workflows (If Applicable)

*   **Goal:** Leverage AI to provide smart, contextual assistance.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Task 8.1: Contextual Command Suggestions:**
        *   Based on current file type, open files, or recent actions, suggest relevant shell commands or project-specific build/run commands.
        *   *Hint:* Maintain a history of executed commands and analyze project structure.
    *   **Task 8.2: Code Explanation/Summarization:**
        *   Allow users to select a code block and send it to an integrated LLM (e.g., via the `enhanced_ollama_agent` if local models are available) for explanation or summarization. Display results in a new panel.
        *   *Hint:* Requires integration with an LLM API or local LLM agent.
    *   **Task 8.3: Log Analysis Helper:**
        *   Provide a feature to feed log file content into an LLM to identify anomalies, summarize errors, or extract key information.
        *   *Hint:* This could be a specialized command within the TUI.

### F. Customization and Extensibility

*   **Goal:** Empower users to tailor the TUI to their needs and extend its functionality.
*   **Tasks:**

## IV. General Implementation Hints

*   **Choose a Robust TUI Library:** Select a well-maintained Python TUI library (e.g., `Textual` by Textualize is a modern choice, `Rich` for beautiful terminal output, `Urwid` for more low-level control). This will greatly simplify UI rendering and event handling.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Many features (code analysis, Git operations, LLM calls) will be long-running. Use `asyncio` or threading to ensure the TUI remains responsive.
*   **Modular Design:** Break down each feature into small, manageable components. Use a clear separation of concerns (e.g., UI rendering logic separate from application logic).
*   **State Management:** Implement a clear state management pattern (e.g., Redux-like, observable patterns) to manage the application's state and trigger UI updates.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and display informative messages to the user within the TUI.
*   **Performance Optimization:** For real-time features (linting, search), optimize for performance. Consider caching results where appropriate.
*   **User Feedback Loops:** Constantly gather feedback from users to iterate and refine features.
*   **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for TUI components and backend logic.
*   **Configuration:** Design a flexible configuration system (e.g., YAML, TOML) for all customizable aspects.
